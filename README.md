<!-- 
If you're reading this, you've probably seen that previous versions of this Readme had links to Mindustry. I originally relied on Anuken's Mindustry Readme. I had no idea how to make a Readme.md. I now have more knowledge of this and used a better Readme. Adapted to my needs.
Thank you for understanding my inexperience and I'm sorry for only taking the Anuken template
